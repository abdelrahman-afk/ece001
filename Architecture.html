        <p>Current architectural-level full-system software-based simulators (e.g. Virtutech Simics) are
developed to run on single-threaded hosts and are thus limited in throughput, especially when simulating
multiprocessor systems. The slowdown becomes even higher when attaching additional modules to the
simulator, such as cache models. Simulating a uniprocessor system is typically thousands of times slower
than the actual single CPU system, which is still considered an acceptable slowdown by software
researchers. However, simulation of a multiprocessor system on a single host is up to a million times
slower than the real hardware. This makes execution of large multiprocessor workloads - be it scientific
or server workloads - prohibitively slow.
Statistical sampling of computer system simulation [1, 2, 3] can reduce simulation times by roughly
a factor of 10000. This is done by employing systematic sampling to measure only a very small portion of
the entire workload being simulated. Between measurements, a simplified functional simulation model of
the system that also advances the architectural state of the system is used to fast-forward through the
workload. Actual measurements are taken using detailed timing-accurate models of the components
comprising the simulated system. The use of checkpointing to capture the architectural state of the system
can even further accelerate simulation [3].
In addition to statistical sampling, recent research in the field of hybrid simulation has also greatly
accelerated multiprocessor system simulation using FPGAs (e.g. Protoflex [4, 5]). This corresponds to
arrow 1 in figure 1. Protoflex uses transplant technology to dynamically accelerate only common-case
behaviors while relegating infrequent, complex behaviors (e.g., I/O devices) to software simulation.
Transplanting avoids having to implement the entire target system in an FPGA. Protoflex is an invaluable 
tool for fast-forwarding through large workloads and collecting checkpoints. However attaching
additional software-based simulator components, such as cache models, greatly limits simulation speed
and throughput of Protoflex.</p>
