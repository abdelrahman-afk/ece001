            <p>FACS (FPGA-Accelerated Cache Simulator) is a fully parameterizable hardware functional piranhabased [6] multiprocessor cache model that precisely replicates the behavior of the existing software-based
TraceCMPFlex cache model. This corresponds to arrow 2 in Figure 1. FACS can receive and process
dynamically generated references from Protoflex at full speed, allowing simulation to proceed without
any slowdown. For each incoming memory reference FACS updates the cache tags and maintains
coherence among the private L1 caches, while also keeping detailed L1 and L2 cache statistics. Our
results show that FACS is roughly 200 times faster than the equivalent software functional cache model it
simulates. When combined with FACS, ProtoFlex can accelerate a full 16-cpu chip multiprocessor with
private 64KB L1 I&D caches and a 16MB shared L2 by a factor of roughly 100x</p>

          <p class="p1">Software Development
FACS also required a significant amount of software development, which mainly concerned Flexus, as
mentioned in the software methodology section above. In addition, a couple of additional tools were
developed to help analyze the cache statistics results from FACS and Flexus:
Converter
Converter is a simple C++ program to translate the dumped memory references from Flexus into the
binary format recognizable by FACS. The devising of a binary format involved a fair amount of hacking
to overcome the architectural characteristics of the PowerPC on the BEE2 board, as mentioned in the
hardware methodology section above.
Comparator
Comparator is a simple Python script to automate the comparison of the L2 and the 16 L1 I- and Dcache statistics from FACS and Flexus. It reports the total references from each model and displays any
discrepancies. A thorough analyses of the L1 and L2 statistics is presented in Appendix A.
Results
In order to evaluate FACS we compared the time it takes to process references using the software
TraceCMPFlex cache model against the time it takes to process the references using FACS. Figures 4 and
5 plot the required time to process millions of references and Figure 6 shows the equivalent speedup
values. For the Flexus TraceCMPFlex software-based cache simulator we plot two curves, which
correspond to the execution on two different machines with the following specifications.
An Intel Xeon @ 2.8GHz with 512KB L2 cache and 3GB RAM (2 cores in total; machine
tamdhu in the ECE Scotch cluster)
A dual Intel Xeon 5130 running at 2GHz with 4MB shared L2 cache and 8GB RAM (4 cores in
total; machine brackla in the ECE Scotch cluster)
For FACS, our hardware cache model, we also plot two separate curves. The first curve corresponds
to the common case, where the average L1 cache hit rate is above 75%. This is typical for most programs
and was true for all of the workloads that we tried. The second curve corresponds to the worst case, where 
all references miss in the L1 cache (0% L1 cache hit rate). In either case FACS is roughly 200 times faster
than the software cache simulator, regardless of which machine is it executed on.</p>
